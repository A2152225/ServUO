Happy 4th if July 
Everyone give a round of applause to Pin for exploding like a firework for this occasion :)


Merry Christmas

I've added in the (non dan related) additional resources, so those should be working now.  Feel free to play around with them, Added the animal bod system too, but it seems to not be showing up on the vendors --  I haven't made any changes to that system yet, so brush is available, as are the dyes at this time.



Happy Thanksgiving


Be on  the look out for a few Giant Turkeys that got loose in the Despise Region earlier today. They escaped when we were trying to shove them in an oven, turns out they were too big to fit.

They are considered Dangerous so if you can return them, dead preferably, we can perhaps cook their remains for a large Thanksgiving day feast!

P.S.  They might be too hard to kill alone, so you may need to gather a group of friends to help you.

Update: Giant Turkeys have had their health reduced significantly (for now)
