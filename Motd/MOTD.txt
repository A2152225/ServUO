Happy Thanksgiving


Be on  the look out for a few Giant Turkeys that got loose in the Despise Region earlier today. They escaped when we were trying to shove them in an oven, turns out they were too big to fit.

They are considered Dangerous so if you can return them, dead preferably, we can perhaps cook their remains for a large Thanksgiving day feast!

P.S.  They might be too hard to kill alone, so you may need to gather a group of friends to help you.

Update: Giant Turkeys have had their health reduced significantly (for now)
